/** Write a recursive function called fib which accepts a number and returns the nth number
 * in the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of whole
 * numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... which starts with 1 and 1,
 *  *  and where every number thereafter is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers. */

// fib(0) => 0
// fib(3) => 2
// fib(5) => 5

// This is just a test
