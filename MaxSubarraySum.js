/** Write a function caled maxSubSum which accepts an array of integers and a number called n. 
The function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array

	maxSubSum([1,2,5,2,8,1,5], 2) // 10
    maxSubsum([1,2,5,2,8,1,5]), 4) // 17

// first write the naive solution with nested loops O(N^2)




// Then write the solution using a "sliding window"
// You subtract the bottom and add the top as you slide the window
// This will be O(N)
